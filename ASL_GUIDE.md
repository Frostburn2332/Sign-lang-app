2. **Background**: Use a plain, contrasting background
3. **Distance**: Keep your hand 1-2 feet from the camera
4. **Clarity**: Make clear, distinct gestures
5. **Stillness**: Hold each sign steady for 1-2 seconds
6. **Hand Orientation**: Face your palm toward the camera for most signs

## Learning Resources

Visit the **Learn** page to see visual examples of each letter and practice making the signs!

## Common Issues

- **"Unknown" detection**: Make sure your hand is clearly visible and well-lit
- **Wrong letter detected**: Check your hand position matches the reference images
- **No detection**: Ensure camera permissions are granted and hand is in frame

## Note on Dynamic Signs

Some letters (J, Z) require motion to be fully accurate. The app detects their static starting positions and indicates this with "(static)" in the detection label.
